Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/applin/rails`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Install
To add the gem to your Rails application:

    $ bundle add applin-rails

2. Test it with <https://github.com/leonhard-llc/applin-rails-example>
1. Update the version number in `version.rb`
